# Installation 
This is distributed as an unpacked extension to ensure it is easy to see all the code before installing it. Click the most recent release on the right-hand side of the screen; download and extract the source to a separate folder.
To install an unpacked extension go to chrome://extensions/ and click the "load unpacked" button (you may need to enable developer mode) and select the folder. If you delete the folder later the extension will be rudely uninstalled.
